        <div class="subheading mb-5">Media and Cultural Studies ðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a third-year Media and Cultural Studies major looking for future jobs and internships regarding UX/UI design. I am very interested in the tech industry and am very passionate about design, and overall the way things look. I love aesthetics and making things look pretty.The world is evolving and there are so many more opportunities and jobs that will want more people with experience in these fields. I am taking this course to familiarize myself with the tech industry and get more background knowledge with computer science. Because computer science is a big industry and many companies are paying well for knowledge and experience in this area, I think it is at least more beneficial to take the time in my college career to learn more about it. UX design, I feel, also requires at least some expertise in computer science in order to be the most successful for this job. I am so excited to be learning more about computer science and where it will take me.  <br><br>

        So far, I have earned my first job working as a barista and server at a restaurant called Cha2O in Riverside, next to the University of California Riverside. For my very first job, I was nervous at first because I didn't really have any experience prior besides my many years of Girl Scouts. All my life, I have had experience in here and there from Girl Scouts, from selling Girl Scouts cookies in front of grocery markets to mentoring young girls. So when finally working at my first job, I was able to use all those skills that I have learned and gained throughout the years, I wasn't so nervous and anxious getting more into the job. I did have to learn the up's and down's to customer service, which was pretty hard in some cases. I worked at my first job for about a year and a half and even worked my way up to shift lead to train new employees. Working at Cha2O has taught me so much. <br><br>

       As stated before, I am looking for more opportunities to grow and better my experience in UX and graphic design. Growing up, I have always loved making and creating art. Most friends and family members would say that I have a very well diverse creative side and am also eager to learn. Because I grew up in the generation of watching YouTubers grow and expand their platform, part of me wanted the chance to do so too. However, I never got to making videos, I always trying to perfect the channel art and channel banners so that my channel page would look very aesthetic and eye catching. I enjoyed watching other YouTube videos explaining which ways were the best to design the banners and even some tips and ticks to editing. I dabbled in editing videos here and there as well, and still to this day enjoy editing videos. I even joined a club where I took part in editing videos for our showcase night. Being part of a team made it ten times better also!
